# Mp4Hide
This will divide a .mp4 file into thousands if not millions of .txt files. The purpose of this is in the air, but one use I can think of would be to get media through censorship pipelines without detection! It is by no means the best way to accomplish this, but is defintely a hidden in plain sight approach. 

STEPS - 

1: Place the Hider.py in a file contaning only a .mp4 file. 
 
  WARNING - this file will be consumed with .txt files so don't place in a directory full of other .txt files or files in general. 

2: Open a terminal and cd into the target file with the mp4. 

3: type--> Python3 Hider.py Go 
This will hide the .mp4 as the .txt files and delete the original .mp4

4: Remove the Hider.py from the folder and zip it up to be sent off to target. 

5: Recipient should also have Hide.py on their system. 

6: They will replace the Hider.py within the folder after it is unzipped. 

7: cd into target folder within a terminal and run --> Python3 Hider.py Goed

8: The recovered .mp4 file will be left in the folder and all .txt files will be deleted! 

EXTRA -- I can't speak on how this will work on Windows machines but I am sure you can get this to work.
